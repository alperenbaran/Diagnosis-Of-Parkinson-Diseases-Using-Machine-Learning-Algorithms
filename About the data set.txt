In this model, a prediction model is established with the drawing samples in the publicly shared NewHandPD dataset.
The image files that consist of drawing samples were aimed to be classified as “healthy” or “patient”.
Hyperparameter Tuning model consists of %60 Train-%20 Validation-%20 Test.
Prediction Model consists of %80 Train- %20 Test because off the small size of dataset.
